The quiz application was developed as a hands-on project to strengthen my understanding of front-end technologies. I used HTML to structure the content, CSS to design an engaging and responsive user interface, and JavaScript to implement the quiz logic, including question navigation, scoring, and interactive features. The application consists of a welcome screen, a question interface, and a result display, offering a smooth and user-friendly experience. Through this project, I explored DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content rendering, which helped deepen my skills in building interactive web applications.
